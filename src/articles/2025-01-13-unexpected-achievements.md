title: Reflecting on a Year of Unexpected Achievements
---

When I think back over the last 12 months or so, I can barely believe some of it has happened.

The most recent example is that I now have [a course with Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/pro-css/?utm_source=teacher-post&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=pro-css).

This was a big deal for me because I signed up for Frontend Masters when I first started getting into web development.

It was one of my favourite resources for high-quality course content, including WIll Sentance's JavaScript the Hard Parts, which is one of my favourite courses that I've completed.

So when they approached me to create a course, I was kind of blown away.

I had to say yes because it was something I never imagined I'd do.

Having my name up amongst the people who have courses with Frontend Masters seems unreal, even though it's up there right now for me to see.

**But it wasn't just that course.**

I also started doing public speaking, which led to some incredible opportunities:

1.  **CSS Day**: This was my ultimate goal when I started doing conferences. I wanted to build up to one day being able to speak at it... and then it was the first main-stage talk I ever did, and I had Miriam Suzanne, one of my CSS heroes, introducing me on stage ðŸ¤¯.
2.  **Smashing Conference**: Before I got into web development (back when I did print design), Smashing was a conference I had always wanted to attend. Being invited as a speaker was mind-blowing. I shared the stage with people like Jessica Hische and Brad Frost, the two of which I've been following since before I started teaching and both of which I've looked up to for a very long time now.

## The "Accidental" Expert

I realize that a lot of people see me as an industry expert within the CSS niche.

I see myself as this random dude who likes writing CSS.

I guess I probably should see it like everyone else does, but as I often tell people, I sort of accidentally got here because:

*   I never planned to teach
*   I never planned to get into web development
*   When I started my YouTube channel, I never planned for it to be more than a hobby project

Someone once asked me why I always say I got here accidentally. They pointed out that it sounds like I'm discrediting everything I've done to get where I am now. And yeah, that's true, I probably am!

### Acknowledging Skills and Success

I do think I'm good at communicating, and I think that's why my channel has been successful. I'm good at understanding something well enough to be able to communicate it in a way that other people can understand when they're struggling with it.

But I still don't see myself at the same level as those other people I mentioned - the ones I'm going on stage with or the experts sitting in the front row listening to me at conferences.

The way I see it is I learn everything from those smart people and then find use cases for it, and I am decent at communicating those ideas and concepts.

Again, that might be discrediting myself, but it's hard to acknowledge that maybe I know what I am doing.

### The Reality of Imposter Syndrome

The reason it's so hard is imposter syndrome lives strong in me, lol.

I get major imposter syndrome bouts whenever these opportunities come up.

I worry that, as soon as I get on stage and start talking, all those heroes of mine that are in the front row will realize I'm a fraud.

Or, when I show up to record a course at a professional studio like that of Frontend Masters, where they've already had a bunch of people who know what they are doing make courses with them, they'll regret having asked me to come and wonder how the hell I ever made a name for myself.

Obviously, I wouldn't be where I am today if any of that was true.

The analytical part of my brain realizes that.

But it doesn't mean those thoughts don't still happen.

## It's been a dream come true

But, at least so far, I haven't been found out ðŸ˜†.

Every talk I've done has gone really well.

The Frontend Masters course turned out amazing (at least in my own humble opinion, lol).

**Honestly, these last 12 months have been a bunch of my wildest dreams, all coming true at once.**

And, while I've put in the work over the last 9 years to make this all possible, I also wouldn't be here if it wasn't for everyone who's watched and shared my videos, enrolled in my courses, and helped support me this entire time, **so a very big thank you to you for helping make all of this possible**.
